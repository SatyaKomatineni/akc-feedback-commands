# About
1. This is a chrome extension to explore telugu words in a dictionary without retyping them
2. Highlight a telugu word and right click to see its meaning
3. Navigate like a lost soul from word to word


# How does this extension work
1. On any web page highlight a telugu word
2. Right click on the selected word once it is highlighted
3. You will see a menu item called "Lookup T"
4. If you choose the menu item, the current tab is redirected to the meaming page of that word in the telugu dictionary AndhraBharati.com/dictionary
5. Once you are at the dictionary you can do this for any telugu word on the dictionary page
6. This is basically hyperlinking every word  in that dictionary so that you can explore the dictionarly endlessly without retyping the word

# Security considerations
1. The selected word is sent to andhrabharati.com in a web request
2. Nothing else
3. I don't own the site AndhraBharati.com
4. So it is possible that the looked up words could be tracked and stored. 
5. But you are in control of what words you are choosing
6. It is equivalent to intentionally typing that word in the dictionary
